<h1>Classifier Generator</h1>
Python script designed to facilitate testing multiple Scikit Learn classification algorithms. To use simply run supervised_learning_util_wip.py on any python engine after having installed dependencies. This repo includes C# code for a GUI but best performance is achieved when running the Python scripts alone.
